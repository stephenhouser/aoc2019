# Day 7: Amplification Circuit

Intcode, multiple instances, permutations of vector

## Part 1

Run multiple copies of intcode program to find best configuration.
- 5 amplifilers
- each takes phase setting [0,4] and power input (first takes 0 as power level)

"find the largest output signal that can be sent to the thrusters"

Permutations

**Each phase setting is used exactly once**

## Part 2
