# Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

Iteration, map, reduce/fold, recursion.

Trying [rust](https://rust-lang.org/) for as long as I can.
Did this in both C++ and rust. Rust is slightly faster.

## Part 1

Once I got the basics of reading a file in rust, this was simple iteration
(map and reduce).

## Part 2

Add in a little recursion to the map and reduce.
