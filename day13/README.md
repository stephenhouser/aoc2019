# Day 13: Care Package

Intcode variation

## Part 1

More or less, pump the Intcode computer...

Run the program, collect the outputs in chunks of 3, count
the ones with type == 2 (blocks). Seems to be no overlap, 
so don't need the screen.

## Part 2

- set memory[0] = 2 (free play)
- input is joystick -1, 0, 1
- output (-1, 0) is display value is score

Beat the game by breaking blocks

(do I need visualization?)
